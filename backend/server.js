      Person: Is marginalisation and inequality, both generally, but more particularly in southern Africa, sustainable in the longer term? Do the marginalised form a potential force of political protest that can bring about a change towards greater equity, perhaps through a more development-orientated state form?
      Assist: The political economist and historian, Robert Cox, predicts that such a “bottom-up” driven change is indeed latent among the marginalised. Other political economists, such as Sandra MacLean (2004:2) argue that inequality has become a threat to human security and is now a “functional” issue of public policy because “...people whose needs are not met are less likely to be productive economically and/or they are more likely to become militantly aggressive in protesting their condition.”
